Cliosight is a low-code platform that allows users to quickly add SQL databases through an intuitive interface. It enables the development of versatile data apps in a matter of minutes using JSON configurations and SQL for reports. As we continue to evolve, we plan to expand our compatibility to include a wide range of cloud databases and data management systems.   

## Building Apps 
With a bottom-up approach, developers can create versatile data applications. Each one is a collection of portable, secure and interconnected widgets that are often nested in order to provide detailed insights. The primary UI components are 
1. Form   
2. Report    
3. Page    
4. Single-page Application     

The primary back-end components are    
1. Trigger   
2. Job
3. Workflow
       
Infrastructure include       
1. Datasources (in-built and external)      
2. Users and Groups for fine-grained access control      
3. Storage for files of any type
4. Notifications
5. AI chat bots to help with SQL query writing and JSON configs.   
      
### Creating Workflows in external code      
Data analysts use workflows to fine-tune machine learning models. Using Cliosight's workflow, users can streamline the process of managing multiple jobs and triggers in an application. By automating data management tasks directly in a external code via API and collecting data in the corresponding databases, the effort needed to manage a project becomes much  lesser than usual.     
         
### Ensuring Trustworthiness
It is indeed possible to designate a form for collecting data into a particular table in an in-built datasource. This is to ensure that the final insights derived from this data is reliable.   
These tables will be restricted in the sense that no other form can be used to populate these tables. Other ways are:     
1. Disable manual access via admin console      
2. Disable importing bulk CSV data into the table through the form    
         
### Sharing Datasets    
In present times developers, data analysts and data scientists dump datasets as .csv files in their local hard disks or share public or private datasets using the in-built Tensorflow or Pytorch libraries. Reports in Cliosight can be used for the same purpose. They can be accessed via Cliosight API and updated in external application code to be written back as a new report or by adding rows to an existing report. The major advantage of sharing datasets this way is that, users can share heterogeneous data with ease in a collaborative work environemnt with diverse technical skills.
