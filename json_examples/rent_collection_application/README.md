### Application Schema    
The house rent application template was created to solve a personal problem. People in cities still use pen and paper to keep an account of partial payments, expenses and details of tenants. Payment is mostly done through cash. Receipts are often missing. We wanted to a way to solve these problems for ourselves and others who have tenants.
