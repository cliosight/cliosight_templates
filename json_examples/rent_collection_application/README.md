### Application Schema    
The house rent application template was created to solve a personal problem. Most people are familiar with messaging services like whatsapp, share pictures in social media, but still prefer to use pen and paper to keep an account of  payments, expenses and personal details of tenants. Transactions are mostly done through cash. Receipts are often missing. We wanted a way to solve these problems for ourselves and others who have tenants.   

### Primary entities
1. Payer       
2. Payee     
3. Revenue       
4. Expense        
5. Inventory (Services and Items)             
6. Rent Receipt       
7. Files    

### Assumptions of the design     
1. The user is located in a remote city in India where electricity and water meters are not IoT enabled.
2. We are looking for a fully reliable method of collecting data through our form interface.
3. Computer vision models provide an acceptable percentage of accuracy.
