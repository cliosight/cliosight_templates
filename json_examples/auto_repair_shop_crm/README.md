### Application Schema    
The auto repair shop CRM template is a modified version of 'Tight the Nut' Garage web application. It is similar to the Revenue and Expenses template, but it was created as a part of our user research while engaging with local offline businesses. We noticed our potential users' preference for mobile apps and conventional CRM software such as Vyapar app, Khatabook and Pagaarbook for billing, accounting, HRM and other purposes. Therefore, we decided to create our own CRM that incorporates features from all these different solutions.
