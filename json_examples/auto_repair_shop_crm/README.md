### Highlights

2. Complex queries in reports, using variables in queries and configurations.
3. Pre-filled values in form edit mode.    
4. Online payment integration.    

### Application Schema    
The auto repair shop CRM template is a modified version of 'Tight the Nut' Garage web application. It is similar to the Revenue and Expenses template, but was created as a part of our user research while engaging with local offline businesses. We noticed our potential users' preference for mobile apps and conventional CRM software such as Vyapar app, Khatabook and Pagaarbook for billing, accounting, HRM and other purposes. Therefore, we decided to create our own application that incorporates certain features from all these different solutions.                

### Primary entities
1. Job Card
2. Invoice
3. Bill     
4. Customer     
5. Supplier    
6. Stock        
7. Service   
8. Order
9. Expense   
10. Vehicle Brand
11. Vehicle Variant     
12. Vehicle Type     
13. Documents - Driving License, Insurance, Identity card soft copy    

### Assumptions of the design     
1. The owner of a vehicle can change on resale, and so a vehicle registration number is not an immutable property of a customer like payment details or phone number.
2. There can be inventory associated with a service like car parts with servicing and vice versa is also applicable, for example, replacement charges for new tyres.    
3. The shop does not provide any any AI damage assessment for insurance claim using photos or videos.
4. The solution does not automate identity document verification with  machine translation for Indian languages.
